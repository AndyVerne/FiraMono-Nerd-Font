# [FiraMono-Nerd-Font](https://github.com/AndyVerne/FiraMono-Nerd-Font)

***[Fira Mono Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) is my font, but it lacks the italics version, so I found the [FiraMono Font version](https://github.com/zwaldowski/Fira/tree/zwaldowski/mod-new/otf) and renamed it to ‘Fira Mono Nerd Font’ internally.***

Hope everyone  enjoys the FiraMono Nerd Font and “its italics”. : )

P.S. The Windows Compatible is named by “Fira Mono NF” internally.
